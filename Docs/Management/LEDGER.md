# Work Ledger — branch/status tracker (lives on develop)

> **Purpose:** single source of truth, always on `develop`, for WHERE every in-flight task/bug lives (branch, worktree) and its current phase/status. This is what makes resuming development, debugging, and merges into develop possible after any interruption. Maintained via `/sln-ledger` and at every phase transition (dispatch, phase change, merge, close). Rules: `workflow.md § Rule 2` (docs land on develop).
>
> **Row lifecycle:** add the row when work is dispatched to a branch/worktree; update `Phase/Step`, `Status`, and `Last commit` at each transition; on merge into develop set Status `merged` and move the row to the Completed section (keep last 20 for audit, prune older).

## Active

| ID | Feature / Bug | Phase / Step | Branch | Worktree | Status | Last commit | Next action |
|----|---------------|--------------|--------|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| — | *(no active branch-tracked work)* | | | | | | |

## Completed (last 20)

| ID | Feature / Bug | Branch | Merged into develop | Commit |
|----|---------------|--------|---------------------|--------|

**Status vocabulary:** `dispatched` · `in progress` · `build failure` · `test failure` · `to review` · `blocked: <reason>` · `ready to merge` · `merged` · `abandoned: <reason>`

**Column notes:**
- **Branch** — the branch holding the changes (empty = work happened directly on develop, docs-only).
- **Worktree** — `.worktrees/<name>` path, or `—` if the worktree was already removed (branch still holds the commits).
- **Last commit** — short hash on the task branch, so a resuming session can `git log <hash>..<branch>` instantly.
- **Next action** — one line: what the next session should do (e.g. "fix failing test X", "await Helder review", "merge after wave 2").

**Resume chain (no globbing):** this ledger row → the feature's `task-log.md` `### Checkpoint` block (live step state, pinged on a ~10-min heartbeat) → read ONLY its Context manifest files. See `session-ops.md § Checkpoint Ping & Context Manifest`.
